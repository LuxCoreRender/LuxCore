LuxRays
=======

LuxRays is the part of LuxRender dedicated to accelerate the ray intersection
process by using GPUs. You can find more information about the ongoing effort of
integrating OpenCL support in LuxRender at http://www.luxrender.net/wiki/index.php?title=Luxrender_and_OpenCL
and at http://www.luxrender.net/wiki/index.php?title=LuxRays

LuxCore
=======

LuxCore is the new LuxRender v2.x C++ and Python API. It is released under Apache Public
License v2.0 and can be freely used in open source and commercial applications. You can
find more information about the API at http://www.luxrender.net/wiki/LuxCore

LuxCoreUI
=========

It is the most complete example of LuxCore API usage and it is available inside
samples/luxcoreui directory.
Just run luxcoreui from the root directory with:

./bin/luxcoreui scenes/luxball/luxball-hdr.cfg

to check how it works.

SLG (SmallLuxGPU)
=================

SmallLuxGPU was a LuxCore/LuxRays demo and was a LuxRender v0.8 "proof of concept". You can find
more information about SLG at http://www.luxrender.net/wiki/index.php?title=SLG
It is now replaced by LuxCoreUI.
