IMPORTANT: 

This is the last release from me as EOS employee. I plan to contribute all of this
work to the official boost libraries distribution and will continue to support users. 
Francois Mauger joined me recently and already added a valuable tutorial for you!


Dear user,

I am proud to announce the very first release of our portable_binary_[io]archive 
which we use here at EOS to move data between different platforms. It really is 
a conglomerate of pieces that already were there - as is most often the case in 
OO world - we simply put them together in a way that seemed to make sense. I know 
a lot of people were interested in portable binary archives, so here you are - 
give it a try and let me know what you think about it!

We rely heavily on boost::serialization and really appreciate the amount of time 
and knowledge that went into it. By publishing this small missing piece we hope 
to contribute our mite to this great library.

The work extends the portable binary example which was done by Robert Ramey and 
uses Beman Dawes' endian library plus the fp_utilities by Johan Rade. You will 
need to get those two libraries in order to use our classes - look for them at 
the boost vault (http://www.boost-consulting.com/vault/) in categories 'integer' 
and 'math - numerics'. Finally you will find the portable binary archive in 
category 'serialization' as well.
