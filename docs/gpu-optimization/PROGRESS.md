# GPU optimization progress log

Append-only. Newest entry at the bottom. Date every entry (YYYY-MM-DD).
Record: what was done, measured numbers, decisions, dead ends, open questions.

## Environment

- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 5070 12 GB (Blackwell, compute capability 12.0).
- OS: Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024.
- CUDA toolkit 12.8 at `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.8`.
- CMake on PATH. Conan not on PATH yet (install with `pip install conan`).
- No build tree yet (`out/` missing). Driver version and NVRTC version
  actually linked by LuxCore: unknown, record in T0.1.

## Baseline

Not measured yet (T0.3).

### 2026-10-26: code review and Phase 1 edits

- Reviewed the CUDA/OptiX path; findings are in `PLAN.md` ("Current
  architecture").
- Implemented T1.1-T1.3 (OptiX flags, removed `--Ofast-compile=min`, params
  upload only on change). Not built, not measured. Committed on branch
  `gpu-opt/T1.1-T1.3-optix-nvrtc`.
- Found: CUDA kernel cache key ignores NVRTC built-in options; clear
  `%TEMP%\luxcorerender.org\cuda_kernel_cache` after option changes (T1.4).
- Found: CUDA block size is always 32 (`CUDADevice::GetKernelWorkGroupSize`
  returns 32, and `opencl.gpu.workgroup.size` forces 32 by default) (T1.5).
- Decided: `--use_fast_math` rejected (risk of NaN/fireflies; violates the
  lossless rule).
- Next: T0.1 build, T0.2 script, T0.3 baseline, then verify T1.1-T1.3.
