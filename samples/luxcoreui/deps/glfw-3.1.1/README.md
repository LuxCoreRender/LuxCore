# GLFW

## Introduction

GLFW is a free, Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL and OpenGL ES
application development.  It provides a simple, platform-independent API for
creating windows and contexts, reading input, handling events, etc.

Version 3.1.1 adds fixes for a number of bugs that together affect all supported
platforms, most notably workarounds for bugs in some popular window managers.

If you are new to GLFW, you may find the
[introductory tutorial](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html) for GLFW
3 useful.  If you have used GLFW 2 in the past, there is a
[transition guide](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/moving.html) for moving to
the GLFW 3 API.

Note that a number of source files have been added or renamed in 3.1, which may
require you to update any custom build files you have.


## Compiling GLFW

See the [Compiling GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html) guide in
the GLFW documentation.


## Using GLFW

See the
[Building programs that use GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html)
guide in the GLFW documentation.


## Reporting bugs

Bugs are reported to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues).
Please always include the name and version of the OS where the bug occurs and
the version of GLFW used.  If you have cloned it, include the commit ID used.

If it's a build issue, please also include the build log and the name and
version of your development environment.

If it's a context creation issue, please also include the make and model of your
graphics card and the version of your driver.

This will help both us and other people experiencing the same bug.


## Dependencies

GLFW bundles a number of dependencies in the `deps/` directory.

 - [Khronos extension headers](https://www.opengl.org/registry/) for API
   extension symbols used by GLFW
 - [getopt\_port](https://github.com/kimgr/getopt_port/) for examples
   with command-line options
 - [TinyCThread](https://github.com/tinycthread/tinycthread) for threaded
   examples
 - An OpenGL 3.2 core loader generated by
   [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for examples using modern OpenGL

## Contact

The official website for GLFW is [glfw.org](http://www.glfw.org/).  There you
can find the latest version of GLFW, as well as news, documentation and other
information about the project.

If you have questions related to the use of GLFW, we have a
[support forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/glfw/discussion/247562/), and the IRC
channel `#glfw` on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/).

If you have a bug to report, a patch to submit or a feature you'd like to
request, please file it in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues) on GitHub.

Finally, if you're interested in helping out with the development of GLFW or
porting it to your favorite platform, we have an occasionally active
[developer's mailing list](https://lists.stacken.kth.se/mailman/listinfo/glfw-dev),
or you could join us on `#glfw`.
